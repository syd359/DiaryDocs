## 1. PU Learning  
Positive and Unlabeled Learning, also called learning from positive and unlabeled examples.  
> In PU learning, two sets of examples are assumed to be available for training:   
the positive set **P** and a mixed set **U**, which is assumed to contain both positive and negative samples, but without these being labeled as such.   
This contrasts with other forms of semisupervised learning, where it is assumed that a labeled set containing examples of both classes is available in addition to unlabeled samples. 
A variety of techniques exist to adapt supervised classifiers to the PU learning setting, including variants of the EM algorithm.
